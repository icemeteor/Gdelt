    "3. Using each topic’s multinomial distribution, output words to fill the document’s word slots. In our example, the “health” topic is 1/2 our document, or 3 words. The “health” topic might have the word “diet” at 20% probability or “exercise” at 15%, so it will fill the document word slots based on those probabilities.\n",
